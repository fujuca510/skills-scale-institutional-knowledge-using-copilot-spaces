# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome to OctoAcme's project management documentation! This guide provides a comprehensive overview of how we run projects, from initial concept to deployment and continuous improvement.

## Project Management Process Summary

OctoAcme uses a structured, iterative, and customer-focused approach to project management. Our methodology ensures clear ownership, measurable outcomes, effective communication, proactive risk management, and continuous improvement throughout the project lifecycle.

### Core Principles

- **Customer-first**: Prioritize customer value and usability in all decisions
- **Iterative delivery**: Deliver small, testable increments to enable faster feedback
- **Clear ownership**: Each project has a named Project Manager (PM) and Product Lead
- **Data-informed decisions**: Measure impact and iterate based on evidence
- **Psychological safety**: Encourage feedback, learning, and blameless retrospectives

### Key Roles

- **Project Manager (PM)**: Coordinates delivery, schedules, risk management, and communications
- **Product Manager (PdM)**: Defines outcomes, prioritizes the backlog, and measures success
- **Developers**: Implement features, collaborate on design, and ensure testability
- **QA/Testing**: Validate quality and acceptance criteria
- **Stakeholders**: Provide inputs, feedback, and approvals

### Key Artifacts

- Project Charter / One-pager
- Roadmap and Release Plan
- Sprint/Iteration Backlog
- Acceptance Criteria & Definition of Done
- Risk Register
- Retrospective notes and action items

### Project Lifecycle Stages

1. **Initiation**: Define problem statement, identify stakeholders, and establish high-level timeline
2. **Planning**: Break down work into shippable increments, identify dependencies and risks
3. **Execution & Tracking**: Build, test, review, and iterate with regular team syncs
4. **Release & Deployment**: Deploy to production, verify functionality, and announce release
5. **Retrospective & Continuous Improvement**: Capture learnings and convert them into actionable improvements
